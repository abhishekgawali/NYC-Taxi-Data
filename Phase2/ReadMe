Phase 2: 

Propose a document-oriented model for your dataset and compare it with your relational model.You should also provide code to load your data into this model. 

Provide a program that issues at least five interesting SQL queries over the previous relational model and propose indexes to speed up query execution (report your timings). 

Discover and explain functional dependencies and discuss normalization with respect to the relational model you provided in Phase I.
